# Tools Package

This package includes some auv-specific tools, hardware-interfaces, models,
and messages.

## Dry Test:

Part of this package includes scripts to automate drytests, allowing one to
easily check the functionality of hardware.

_Requires xterm to open image_view internally; gnome-terminal was being silly._

To use:
```
roslaunch tools drytest.launch
````
