I have manually installed the "find_objects_2d" package using
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-find_objects_2d.

If the launch file is not working for you, It's likely because 
    1. you need to change the image topic to whatever your camera is outputting 
    OR
    2. you need to install this package with the above syntax

This should be bound into compsys...when someone gets a minute ;]
